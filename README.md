Hello World

My name is Zoe and I am a student at the University of Iowa majoring in Accounting and Business Analytics. I am from the Des Moines area and I love traveling around the world, but my favorite place is in Clear Lake, Iowa. My family has a lake house there where we spend a lot of our time in the summers.
